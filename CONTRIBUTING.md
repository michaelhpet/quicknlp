### Roadmap

QuickNLP currently features the following NLP algorithms:

- Paraphrasing
- Summarization
- Grammar checking

These algorithms are considerably performant and fairly accurate. However, they algorithms are open to improvement, especially support for more options, output format, and accuracy. You are welcome to explore the existing implementations and submit any opinion, proposals, or inovation whatsoever.
